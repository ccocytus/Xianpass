# XianPass

**XianPass** is a password generator I created back in high school. Itâ€™s designed to help you create secure and strong passwords to protect your confidential information.

## Overview

XianPass is all about security and simplicity. The tool allows you to generate unique and robust passwords for all your accounts, ensuring that your data remains safe and sound. It was a fun project I worked on a while ago, so if the code isn't perfect, wellâ€¦ that's because it was written during my high school days! ðŸ˜„

You can check out the XianPass website here: [XianPass](http://cocytus.site/xianpass/Code/Acceuil.html).

**Important Note**: The site is frontend-only, meaning there's no backend involved. The password generation happens entirely in JavaScript, right in your browser. And just so you know, the project was never actually finished, so some parts might be incomplete or rough around the edges.

## Features

- **Secure Password Generation**: Create strong and unique passwords tailored to each of your accounts.
- **Confidentiality**: Ensure the security of your sensitive data with passwords that are difficult, if not impossible, to guess.
- **Password Recovery**: Never worry about forgetting your passwords thanks to our recovery function.

## User Interface

The website is straightforward and easy to use. Just select your desired options and click "Create a Password" to generate a strong password instantly.

### Active Options

- **Minuscule (a-z)**
- **Majuscule (A-Z)**
- **Nombres (0-9)**
- **Symboles (!-$+^)**
- **Exclude Duplicates**: Make sure your password doesnâ€™t contain repeated characters.
- **Include Spaces**: Add spaces to your password for additional complexity.

### Additional Features

- **Fingerprint Login**: For enhanced security, XianPass offers a fingerprint login feature.
- **Security On**: Strong passwords, impossible to guess, keep your data secure.
- **Forgot Password**: If you forget your password, XianPass has got you covered with a recovery feature.

## Nostalgia

This project was something I built when I was just starting out in coding. So, if the implementation seems a bit clunky, remember itâ€™s from my early days! Itâ€™s a nice reminder of how far Iâ€™ve come since then. If you ever stumble across the code, just know that the learning curve was steep, but I had a lot of fun working on it. ðŸ˜‚

## Conclusion

XianPass was a great project that helped me learn a lot about web development and security. Itâ€™s a simple tool, but it was built with care and a genuine interest in keeping information safe. Feel free to try it out, and donâ€™t judge the code too harshly!
